collective.base64imagepatch Installation
----------------------------------------

Dependencies
------------

There are two soft dependencies on the underlaying Content-Types-Frameworks of Plone. 
* Archetypes
* Dexterity
None of those must be included seperatly in the buildout, as they are already part of Plone.


Installation via zc.buildout
----------------------------
If you are using zc.buildout to manage your Zope/Plone Instances, you can do this:

* Add ``collective.base64imagepatch`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        collective.base64imagepatch
      
* Re-run buildout, e.g. with:

    $ ./bin/buildout
